This is my first practise on git
Checkout: This is the act of switching between different versions
of a target entity. Git checkouy command operate on three different
entities. Files, commits and branches.
Revert: This undo a commit by creatinga new commit. It will create 
a new commit that will undo the changes done to the last commit and tack 
the new commit onto the existing project.
Reset: This is a way to move the tip or head of a branch to a different 
commit it is used to remove or delete commits from the current branch. It
ia a simple way to undo changes that haven't been shared with anyone.
